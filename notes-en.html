        ##Teens Learning Code: Intro to Hardware with Arduino
        <br>

        #Schedule

        **Intro (30 min):** Intro, Agenda, Coders' Code, What is Code, Today's Project

        **Intro to Hardware (1 hour):** What is Arduino, Circuit, Hardware, Follow Circuit Diagrams.

        **Intro to Arduino Programming (1 hour):**  Arduino Create Account Setup, C++ Programming, Compile and Upload, Challenges.

        **Lunch (30 min):** Usually lunch is scheduled around 12:30/45, but sometimes the food arrives later. Break whenever you need to - You can just continue where you left off.

        **Present Problem + Brainstorm (30 min):** Alarm System, Show Material Lists.

        **Break into Project Teams (2 hour):** Wire the system, upload the exisiting code, and craft a disguise.

        **DEMOS + Closing (30 min)** Share outcomes, Next steps, Learning outcomes, Wrap-up.

        #Materials + Special Requirements

        * Learners will need an email address to create a free Arduino Create account.
        * For 12 teens
          * 6 boards + USB
          * 12 Jump wires per board
          * 2 resistors per board
          * 6 buttons
          * 6 LED’s
          * 3 motion sensors - Ultrasonic Range Finder (HC-SR04)
          * 3 buzzers
          * 3 battery pack - 9V Battery + power cord
          * Paper bags, Markers, tape, crafting materials to decorate 


        <br>
        #Contingency

        If you do not have access to the internet, use the following modifications:

        * Copy over learner files onto all computers (link on Welcome slide).
        * Ensure that [Arduino Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) is installed on all computers.
        * Skip working with the Registry.
        * Spend more time sharing projects. Have learners bring their laptops to the front to share on the projector.
        * Please remind learners to save often!


        <br>
        #Notes:

        **Introductions (Slide 3):**
        
        Have mentors stand up and introduce themselves with their name and pronouns.

        Have learners introduce themselves to their table groups and answer an icebreaker question, for example: "If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you want to go?"

        **Arduino (Slide 12):**
        
        This board contains a microcontroller which is able to be programmed to sense and control objects in the physical world. By responding to sensors and inputs, the Arduino is able to interact with a large array of outputs such as LEDs, motors and displays.
        
        Because of it’s flexibility and low cost, Arduino has become a very popular choice for makers and makerspaces looking to create interactive hardware projects. 

        **(Slide 13):**
        
        Clockwise,

        * LilyPad is designed to be easily sewn into e-textiles and wearable projects
        * Arduino Pro Mini is made for small form factor projects
        * Arduino Uno is the most popular with just enough features to create anything
        * Arduino Due is much more powerful with lesser power consumption
        * Arduino Pro Micro is even smaller

        **(Slide 14):**
        
        Ledgend,

        * 1 - Reset Button – This will restart any code that is loaded to the Arduino board.
        * 3 & 14 - Ground Pin – There are a few ground pins on the Arduino and they all work the same.
        * 4 & 12 & 13 - Digital Input/Output – Pins 0-13 can be used for digital input or output.
        * 6 - USB Connection – Used for powering up your Arduino and uploading sketches.
        * 7 - TX/RX – Transmit and receive data indication LEDs.
        * 8 - ATmega Microcontroller – This is the brains and is where the programs are stored.
        * 9 - Power LED Indicator – This LED lights up anytime the board is plugged in a power source.
        * 11 - DC Power Barrel Jack – This is used for powering your Arduino with a power supply.

        **(Slide 22):**

        * Switch, Lightbulb, Battery, eletron flow counterclockwise
        * Schematics may be complicated and taunting

        **(slide 69):** Treat the Take-Home Exercise as a stretch goal if you have any time remaining.
